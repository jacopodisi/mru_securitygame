Pseudocode for the Compute--Cov--Set
Given as input a vertex and a set of target T' under attack (simultaneous)
return the strategies (i.e. the routes) and the utilities associated to that scenario

Moreover you can pass directly the parameters to the solveSRG function that invokes computeCovSets
and returns the best route and utility for a given set of targets, from a a starting position in the graph

We employ lists instead of numpy.array for storing routes since numpy is not optimized for 
managing non-omogenous arrays (while for example we use numpy for the shortest paths matrix)

What is a 'covset'?! [Dr. House]
